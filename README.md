# ACS764-Breakout

This is a Breakout Board for the ACS764XLFTR-32AU-T (& ACS764XLFTR-16AU-T) Integrated, Hall-Effect Based Current Sensor.        This excellent i2c current sensor has been recently unfotuntaely discontinued with no direct replacement. However it's still a fun sensor to use. The Breakout board has I2C pull-up resistor pads and a voltage divider network for I2C addressing purposes, all on easy to solder 1206 pads. The Board also has standard spade terminals & 2.54mm headers sapced for use on standard breadboards.
